# Mechanical Heart Valve Design Optimization

## Project Overview
This project aims to shed light on a critical question: Why do heart valve prostheses cause blood coagulation? The goal is to improve the heart valve structure to reduce complications such as thrombosis and thromboembolism, and to analyze the stress and strain distribution and blood flow velocity pattern through the valve in order to improve the geometrical defects of the valve.

## Features
- **SolidWorks**: 3D design of a mechanical heart valve prosthesis (a bileaflet valve)
- **Abaqus**: Valve analysis

## Objectives
- Improve the heart valve structure to reduce complications such as thrombosis and thromboembolism
- Analyze the stress and strain distribution and blood flow velocity pattern through the valve
- Improve the geometrical defects of the valve


I warmly welcome your feedback, suggestions, and contributions to further enhance the functionality and value of this project.
